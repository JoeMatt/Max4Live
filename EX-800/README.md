# Max for Live : Korg Poly 800 MKII and EX-800 Program and Mod by @JoeMatt

## Overview

The Korg Poly 800 II & EX-800, have very simple MIDI controls.

They can only receive 2 CC messages, besides standard `pitch` and `mod wheel`, `ENV to DCO` and `VCF mod amount`. These parameters support real time editing will effect any playing notes.

The 8 bank / 8 Program program change messages can be difficult to figure out their Base 10 equivalent. This patch also makes it simple to select a patch precisely.

Placed before a Live External Device, it will cause the patch to change to the correct number on track load as well.

## Notes

I only have an EX800 to test on but according to the docs for the 800 MKII it should work as well.
